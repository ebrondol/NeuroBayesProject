Check the right variable settings one last time with the four var2-files. May the best one be taken!

At the moment recheck variables with the new_up and down files. Then find the best global preprocessing flag (at the moment run in tryoptions2). Then rerun all other scripts and come back with the perfect adjustment of NeuroBayes.

Also the possibility of plotting is included for every possible output: plot_2D.C, plot_1D_2c.C and plot_1D_3c are stored in work_scripts.

The optionfiles are also short after short a bit modified, nameconvention string#.opt and variables#.opt, which should always be writeprotected.

ToDos:
- Plots of run_plot.C don't have titles on axis!
